## Multi linear regression - step-by-step statistical methodology of model building

In this project I'm trying to implement statitical analysis for the dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality
It is divided into four parts:


	
 Model Development
	
	- Multiple Linear Regression
	
  Model Review and Evaluation
	- Rsquare

	

## Softwares and Libraries Used:

   - Anaconda Distribution
	- Jupyter Notebook
- SkitLearn
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Matplotlib
	- Seaborn
	
## Importing the Modules:

	  import pandas as pd
	  import numpy as np
	  import math
	  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	  import seaborn as sns
    import statsmodels.api as sm
